DJANGO E-COMMERCE WEB PROJECT

This is my first web project using Django, HTML and CSS.

Still in construction.

Steps:
1) pip install requirements.txt
2) manage.py makemigrations
3) manage.py migrate
4) manage.py createsuperuser
5) manage.py runserver
6) add info to the admin panel and see the results :)
